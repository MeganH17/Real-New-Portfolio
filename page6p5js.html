            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This interactive sketch explores the theme of "Data Portrait" This data portrait visualizes my personal habit of yawning throughout a week, giving an artistic representation of how many times I yawn each day. Each day’s data is visualized as a vertical bar within a square, dimly-lit background, which adds to the somber or subdued feeling of yawning. The portrait is centered around an image of a woman yawning, symbolizing the focus of my self-tracking effort. I wanted to capture the everyday, often unconscious act of yawning and present it as data in an artful way, showing how my energy or sleepiness varies over the week. Through this assignment, I learned that yawning is surprisingly varied, especially when influenced by sleep patterns and daily activities. Self-tracking made me more aware of my body’s responses and led me to think about how unconscious habits like yawning might reveal larger trends in my mood or energy levels. In the process of visualizing this data, I gained a more insightful perspective on my sleep and alertness patterns. However, the data visualization sometimes felt limiting since it captured just one dimension of my tiredness without explaining the cause (like a poor night’s sleep). The abstract design also might not communicate the precise data clearly to all viewers, which made me realize the balance needed between artistic representation and readability in data visualization.</p>
