            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This interactive sketch explores the theme of "Lost & Found." 
                My partner’s name - Longren
                The object description I received from Longren: 
                “I lost a black bracelet with ying and yang beads in it while I was moving out”
                
                Reflection:
                This assignment taught me a lot about the basics of creating code that can form a simple image. I am thrilled to be able to get a description of Longren (my partner) that is unique and detailed enough so that I can learn a lot from it. Initially, I had 2 ideas to illustrate the description. The first interpretation is to make a bracelet with almost all black beads and one ying and yang bead, or the second, is a bracelet where all the beads are ying and yang. In the end, I chose the first option because I found it to be more interesting. 
                When I code, I feel challenged to create something interesting. Finally, I decided to create a gradient behind the object. Then I focused more on how to make yin and yang beads. The final stage is to make the black beads that form the bracelet one by one. 
                At the end of this process, I showed my project to my partner, Longren, and it turned out that my description was correct and followed his wishes.</p>
