            <p>This interactive sketch explores the theme of "Experimental Clock" This clock is a clock that I made to never stop and always loops, even though there is a botton to stop one of the circle to move, I made the others to keep moving. This clock is meant for people who wants to feel rushed. My design process was at first brainstorming at least 3 ideas from my daily life. Here are the ideas: - The clock that changes because of the darkness or the brightness of the screen - The clock that rewinds every time it hits 1 minute - A clock that never stops (still uses hour, minute second) I ended up choosing the last one (nonstop clock) because I like how chaotic and fun a clock that never stop is. Moreover the more I look at this design, I think personally this clock would help me feel rushed and anxiety while looking at it. I learn more everyday through these assignments.From this process I learn more how to use the boolean and also the if statements to make movements of my rectangle and breathing circle. I made this clock to be chaotic I made it with the plan of putting it as a wallpaper of my devices when I need to do homework to make a rushing vibe. Even though it looks like a random clock, the setting of this clock still uses the usual hour, minute, and second, however the visual around it made it to look more chaotic.</p>
