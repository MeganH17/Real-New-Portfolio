            <p>This interactive sketch explores the theme of "Exquisite Corpse" In this P5js assignment I made an individual sketch of a sad stuffed rabbit. Then when I combined it with my group mates, I ended up using Richard's buffalo head, Longren's iron man horse body and my own rabbit legs. This body division is quite fun because I can create a unique character with its own story behind it. I think this task is similar to the first task when we have to create an object that belongs to our friend that is missing. However, this task is much more complex because I have to combine my ideas with those of others. The most difficult thing for me was making the buffalo horn with an arc and making the indentations in it one by one with the circle. Overall I really like the end result, and I feel like I've succeeded in creating a character that is funny and expressive. I think from this assignment I slowly understanding how to make things through code. Especially understanding functions, parameter, arguments. I didn't do a lot of them in this assigments, however I get to slowly getting the courage to adding it in. My favorite part of this assignment is making all of the part coming together. I am glad that I get to finish this assignment according to my expectations.</p>
